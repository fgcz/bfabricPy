The `app.zip` file is an experimental format for packaging a Python application with frozen dependencies and additional
meta-information about your environment.

Basically the scenario is that you freeze all external dependencies (available from PyPI) and add your private Python
packages inside this zip directory.

At a later time this should be migrated to a separate repository.

Please check the subdirectory for all version specific info.
