class MockEngine:
    """This engine supports mocking requests."""

    # TODO the main thing I want to mock:
    #  - ResultContainer
    #  - Ensuring the engine was called with the correct arguments
    #  - Being able to update the ground truth easily
    #  - Redacting sensitive data before adding it to the repository
