# BFabric App Runner Input Handling Architecture

## Overview

The bfabric_app_runner implements a robust, two-phase input processing pipeline designed for handling diverse input types in a consistent and extensible manner. This document analyzes the current architecture and provides guidelines for extending it.

## Architecture Design

### Two-Phase Pipeline

The input handling system follows a clear separation of concerns:

1. **Resolution Phase** (`inputs/resolve/`): Converts various input specifications to standardized resolved types
2. **Preparation Phase** (`inputs/prepare/`): Takes resolved inputs and prepares them in the working directory

This design provides several benefits:
- Clean separation between "what to process" and "how to process it"
- Consistent handling across different input types
- Easy testing and validation at each phase
- Clear extension points for new input types

### Type System

The system uses discriminated unions with Pydantic for robust type checking:

```python
ResolvedInput = ResolvedFile | ResolvedStaticFile | ResolvedDirectory
```

Each resolved type contains:
- `type`: Literal discriminator for type safety
- `filename`: Target path in working directory
- Type-specific metadata for processing

### Current Resolved Types

1. **`ResolvedFile`**: Regular files with source locations
   - Supports local and SSH sources
   - Handles file copying/linking operations
   - Checksum validation support

2. **`ResolvedStaticFile`**: In-memory content written to files
   - String or bytes content
   - Direct file writing
   - No source location needed

3. **`ResolvedDirectory`**: Directory inputs (partially implemented)
   - Supports local and SSH sources
   - Archive extraction (zip)
   - File filtering (include/exclude patterns)
   - Directory structure manipulation (strip_root)

## Implementation Patterns

### Resolver Pattern

The `Resolver` class uses a consistent pattern for handling different input types:

```python
def resolve_inputs(self, inputs_spec: InputsSpec) -> ResolvedInputs:
    resolved_inputs = {}
    
    # Group specs by type and delegate to specialized resolvers
    for spec_type, specs in self._group_specs_by_type(inputs_spec).items():
        match spec_type:
            case "file":
                resolved_inputs.update(self._resolve_file_specs(specs))
            case "static_file":
                resolved_inputs.update(self._resolve_static_file_specs(specs))
            # Pattern continues for each type...
```

### Preparation Pattern

The preparation phase uses pattern matching for type-safe dispatch:

```python
def _prepare_input_files(input_files: ResolvedInputs, working_dir: Path, ssh_user: str | None):
    for input_file in input_files.inputs.values():
        match input_file:
            case ResolvedFile():
                prepare_resolved_file(file=input_file, working_dir=working_dir, ssh_user=ssh_user)
            case ResolvedStaticFile():
                prepare_resolved_static_file(file=input_file, working_dir=working_dir)
            case ResolvedDirectory():
                prepare_resolved_directory(file=input_file, working_dir=working_dir, ssh_user=ssh_user)
```

## Extensibility Design

### Adding New Input Types

The architecture is designed for easy extension. To add a new input type:

1. **Define Input Spec**: Create a new spec class in `specs/inputs/`
2. **Add Resolved Type**: Define the resolved representation in `resolved_inputs.py`
3. **Implement Resolver**: Add resolver function following the established pattern
4. **Implement Preparation**: Add preparation function for the new type
5. **Update Dispatch**: Add pattern matching cases in resolver and preparation

### Design Principles

1. **Consistency**: All input types follow the same processing pattern
2. **Type Safety**: Discriminated unions prevent runtime type errors
3. **Separation**: Clear boundaries between resolution and preparation
4. **Extensibility**: New types can be added without modifying existing code
5. **Testability**: Each phase can be tested independently

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed Components

- **Type System**: All resolved types are defined
- **Dispatch Infrastructure**: Pattern matching is in place
- **File Types**: `ResolvedFile` and `ResolvedStaticFile` are fully implemented
- **Integration**: All components work together seamlessly

### Directory Support Status

The directory support infrastructure is largely complete:

- ✅ **`ResolvedDirectory` Type**: Fully defined with rich metadata
- ✅ **Preparation Dispatch**: Pattern matching case exists
- ✅ **Preparation Function**: Stub exists but raises `NotImplementedError`
- ❌ **Input Spec**: No directory input spec type
- ❌ **Resolver**: No resolver for directory specs
- ❌ **Implementation**: Preparation function not implemented

This indicates that directory support was planned from the beginning but never completed.

## Complexity Assessment

### Current Complexity

The system handles moderate complexity well:

- **Input Spec Types**: 7 different spec types
- **Source Types**: Local files, SSH, bfabric resources, static content
- **Operations**: Copy, link, write, checksum validation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and error reporting

### Design Quality Indicators

1. **Consistent Patterns**: All input types follow the same processing flow
2. **Clear Abstractions**: Well-defined interfaces between components
3. **Type Safety**: Strong typing prevents common errors
4. **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new input types
5. **Testable**: Each component can be tested in isolation

## Recommendations for Directory Support

### Implementation Strategy

Adding directory support would be a natural extension because:

1. **Infrastructure Exists**: Type system and dispatch mechanisms are ready
2. **Consistent Pattern**: Follows established architectural patterns
3. **No Breaking Changes**: Additive changes only
4. **Planned Feature**: `ResolvedDirectory` indicates this was intended

### Implementation Steps

1. Create directory input spec (e.g., `BfabricResourceArchiveSpec`)
2. Implement directory resolver function
3. Complete `prepare_resolved_directory` implementation
4. Add directory spec to resolver dispatch
5. Add comprehensive tests

### Complexity Impact

Adding directory support would **not significantly increase complexity** because:
- All patterns and infrastructure are established
- Implementation follows existing conventions
- No architectural changes needed
- Just filling in missing pieces

## Architecture Strengths

1. **Extensible**: Easy to add new input types
2. **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns
3. **Type Safe**: Discriminated unions prevent errors
4. **Testable**: Each phase can be tested independently
5. **Consistent**: All input types follow the same patterns

## Conclusion

The bfabric_app_runner input handling architecture is well-designed for extensibility. The two-phase pipeline, consistent patterns, and strong type system make it easy to add new input types without increasing complexity. The existing `ResolvedDirectory` type and dispatch infrastructure indicate that directory support was planned from the beginning and would be a natural addition to the system.

The architecture demonstrates good software engineering practices and provides a solid foundation for future enhancements.
